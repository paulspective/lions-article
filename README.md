## 🗒 Notes from Year One

Looking back after my first year of coding…
Some lessons, laughs, and truths I picked up along the way (thanks to Brad, Shaun, and my own bug hunts):

⚠️ **You Google everything**  
Even basic stuff like "how to center a div" or "JavaScript date format" — totally normal.

🔁 **You break stuff. A lot.**  
Then you fix it. Then you break it again. That's the cycle.

✍️ **You write code you don't remember writing**  
…and then spend hours reading your own code like it's someone else's.

🔍 **You debug things that aren’t even broken**  
Turns out it was a missing semicolon or a caching issue. Happens to the best.

🧘‍♂️ **The real skill? Sanity.**  
Debugging will test your soul. Best devs know when to walk away and recharge.

🎉 **That one moment when it finally works**  
Pure joy — absolutely pure joy. Feels like you just won a Grammy.
