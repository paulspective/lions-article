      <h2>The King, Defined</h2>
      <p>The lion <em>(Panthera leo)</em> is a majestic feline species native to Africa and India. Characterized by its
        muscular build, broad chest, a dark hairy tuft at the top of its tail, and distinctive mane in males. Lions are
        sexually dimorphic, with males larger than females. <br> <br> These big cats thrive in prides, typically
        consisting
        of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. Female lions are skilled hunters, working together to
        take
        down prey like ungulates. <br> <br> As apex predators, lions play a vital role in maintaining the balance of
        their
        ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>Life in the Pride</h2>
      <p>Lions stand out from other felines due to their social nature, living in prides with a complex structure. A
        typical pride comprises several related lionesses, a few dominant males, and their offspring. Pride sizes vary
        greatly, ranging from 4 to 37 members, with an average of around 15. <br><br> Each pride occupies a distinct
        territory, fiercely defending its core while allowing some overlap at the fringes. Throughout the day, pride
        members often disperse into smaller groups coming together to hunt or feed.</p>

      <h2>Their Wild Domain</h2>
      <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, and open woodlands. Historically, they ranged across much
        of Europe, Asia and Africa. But now they are found mainly in parts of Africa, south of the Sahara.</p>

    <section id="species" class="content-section">
      <h2>Bloodlines</h2>
      <p>There is only one species of lion, which is known scientifically as <em>Panthera leo</em>, but there
        are several subspecies.</p>
      <h4>Types of Lions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>African Lion</strong> (Panthera leo): Found in savannahs and grasslands across sub-Saharan
          Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>Asiatic Lion</strong> (Panthera leo persica): Found only in the Gir forest of India.</li>
        <li><strong>Other proposed subspecies</strong>: Some sources recognize additional subspecies like the Congo
          lion, Maasai lion, and Katanga lion, but these are not universally accepted.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lions are majestic creatures with loud, echoing roars that can be heard from miles away; complex prides with
        intricate relationship and hierarchies. Powerful physiques, golden coats, shaggy manes in males, and skilled
        predators that work together to take down prey.</p>
      <p>Their majesty is a testament to their adaptability and survival in diverse ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>Legacy and Legend</h2>
      <h3>The legendary Scarface of the Maasai Mara</h3>
      <p>Scarface was one of the most iconic lions in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Known for the distinct
        scar over his right eye, he became a symbol of strength and survival in the wild. Despite suffering multiple
        injuries over the years, Scareface ruled with his coalition for nearly a decade.</p>

        <p>His legacy inspired documentaries, articles, and photography projects. Scarface passed away in 2021 of
          natural causes, surrounded by his pride. His story is a powerful reminder of the challenges and beauty of lion
          life in the wild.</p>

      <h3>Why Lions Are Called the Kings of the Jungle</h3>
      <p>Lions are often referred to as the kings of the jungle, despite the fact that they don't actually live in the
        jungles. This title stems from their majestic appearance, loud roar and dominant role in the animal kingdom.</p>
      <p>In a pride, male lions typically lead, while females do most of the hunting. Their social structure, strength,
        and fearlessness contribute to their legendary status.</p>
